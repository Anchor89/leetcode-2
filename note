Surrounded_Regions:
    take care of the boundary. block O next to boundery is not counted.

Palindrome_Partitioning:
    the initial value of m[0] should push_back an empty vector<string>
    not push_back a vector of {""}

Palindrome_Partitioning_II:
    don't forget to sort (i,j) while coding.
    write down steps before coding.

Longest_Consecutive_Sequence:
    link_jump, or union-set

Word_Ladder:
    O(n*len*26) bfs. don't think too complicate!

Valid Palindrome:
    numbers are belong to alphanumeric. use isalpha(c) and isdigit(c)

Binary_Tree_Maximum_Path_Sum:
    should return a valid path, include at least a node.
    if all node is negative, should not return 0.

Best_Time_To_Buy_and_Sell_Stock_III:
    if n < 2 return 0

Pascal'sTriangle:
    take care n = 0!
Pascal'sTriangle II:
    when n = 0, output the 1th row [1]

Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node:
Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II:
    use the next point of last level
